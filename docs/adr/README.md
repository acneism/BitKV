# Architecture decision records

Each record explains one decision that shapes CasketDB: the context, what was decided and what follows from it, including the costs. How the code works is in [architecture](../architecture.md); these records say why.

A new record gets the next number and the sections Context, Decision and Consequences. A record is not edited when the decision changes: a new record replaces it, and the old one says so on its status line.
